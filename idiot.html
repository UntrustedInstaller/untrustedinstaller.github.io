    <p1>
        this is fucking stupid <br>
        why did I make this <br>
        while we're here, let's talk. So, if you haven't read the rest of the site, I'm Untrusted.
        I'm a shitty artist, I don't know why I put "I love drawing" I mean I do, but I'm terrible at it. Like actually shit. <br>
        Right now, I'm working on collecting Gameboys and modding/restoring them, the only one I have is a glacier blue Gameboy Advance AGB-001 <br>
        if you haven't seen my other repo (project:brew) I'm looking for people willing to help with that project because it's my goal to have an AIO place for homebrew and modding (original, right?) <br>
    </p1>

        as you can see, I'm losing my sanity, why am I acting like this is hidden it's literally in the fucking repo right in plain sight, not like anyone fuckin' checks this place. <br>
        トモダチ <br>
