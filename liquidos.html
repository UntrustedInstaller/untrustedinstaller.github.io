            LiquidOS is a tiny little DOS mockup I made in python. At the moment it really sucks and only
            gets past its fake little system post screen. In the future I hope to allow it to run it's own exectutables and
            almost have something similar to drives (maybe like folders or something that act like hard drives idk)
